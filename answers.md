1. Components of a DBMS
A Database Management System (DBMS) consists of the following components:

Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation operations.
Database Schema: Defines the logical structure of the database (e.g., tables, relationships).
Query Processor: Interprets and executes database queries (e.g., SQL commands).
Transaction Manager: Ensures data consistency during concurrent transactions by supporting ACID properties.
Data Dictionary: Stores metadata about the database, such as table definitions and constraints.
User Interface: Provides tools for users to interact with the database (e.g., GUI, command-line tools).

2. What is a Relational Database?
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) consisting of rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys (e.g., primary and foreign keys).
Examples:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle Database

3. Classifications of SQL
DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines and modifies database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Manipulates data in tables (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
DCL (Data Control Language): Manages access and permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

4. Primary Key vs. Foreign Key
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures no duplicate or null values.
Foreign Key: A column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table to establish relationships.

5. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An ERD is a visual representation of entities, their attributes, and relationships within a database. It helps in designing and understanding database structures.

6. Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity: Maintains accuracy and consistency of data.
Scalability: Supports large datasets efficiently.
Flexibility: Allows complex queries to extract meaningful insights.
Data Security: Provides granular control over access.
Standardization: Uses standardized SQL for queries.

7. Four Types of Data Types in Tables
Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., INT).
String/Text: Stores characters (e.g., VARCHAR, TEXT).
Date/Time: Stores date and time values (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP).
Boolean: Stores true/false values (e.g., BOOLEAN).

8. Purpose of a DBMS
The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide an efficient, reliable, and secure way to store, retrieve, and manage data. It ensures data consistency, supports multiple users, and enables complex querying and reporting.
